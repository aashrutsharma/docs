    Four-layer DPI infrastructure:

    1. **Identity & Verification**: APAAR ID + DigiLocker integration for zero-touch document verification

## Why Aashrut Should Attend FYLS Dubai 2026

### Alignment with Summit Themes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Diplomacy & Multi-Stakeholder Engagement" icon="globe">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ethical Innovation in the AI Era" icon="brain">
    Superadmission uses algorithmic matching (Gale-Shapley) not for profit maximization but for fairness and stability—a rare ethical application of computer science. This aligns with FYLS's focus on values-driven innovation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Youth Leadership & Future Shaping" icon="rocket">
    At 20-21 years old, Aashrut is building infrastructure that will serve hundreds of millions of students over decades. He embodies the "active partner in shaping the world's future" that FYLS seeks to cultivate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Global Network Building" icon="network-wired">
    With 3+ years of international cultural exchange leadership, Aashrut doesn't just attend conferences—he builds lasting cross-border relationships. FYLS would gain a participant who'll leverage connections long after the summit ends.

## Personal Values & Approach

<Note>
  "I've consciously chosen to embrace global exposure and empathy-building over comfort and convention. Superadmission isn't just a business—it's a reform. And reforms require patience, stakeholder alignment, and the humility to serve a cause larger than yourself."
</Note>

**Key Principles:**

- **Service over scale**: Stopped CollegeCult intake to maintain quality
- **Infrastructure over features**: Pivoted to DPI rather than building another ed-tech app
- **Empathy over efficiency**: 3 years hosting international students, learning to listen first
- **Collaboration over competition**: Positioning Superadmission as neutral public good
- **Long-term over quick wins**: Building for decades, not quarters
