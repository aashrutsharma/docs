    Four-layer DPI infrastructure:

    1. **Identity & Verification**: APAAR ID + DigiLocker integration for zero-touch document verification

## Personal Values & Approach

<Note>
  "Building Superadmission isn't about creating another startup—it's about reforming a broken system that perpetuates educational inequity. I've seen firsthand through my work with Muskurahat Foundation how access to education transforms lives. Technology should be the great equalizer, not another barrier."
</Note>

**Key Principles:**

- **Equity over extraction**: Technology should serve all students, not just those who can afford premium services
- **Community over ego**: Learning from nonprofit work that sustainable impact requires patient relationship-building
- **Quality over growth**: Stopped CollegeCult intake to maintain service standards—a principle Unnati championed
- **Collaboration over competition**: Positioning Superadmission as neutral public good, not proprietary platform
- **Purpose over profit**: Building infrastructure that will serve students for decades, not quarters
